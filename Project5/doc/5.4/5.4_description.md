 # 5.4 Front-end interface and screenshoot

We implement our system based on Java Web. After the development and deployment, now we can see this project on the [site](http://119.29.161.49:8080/teacher/).

According to the desciption of our business, we have the follow requirements

- check in the scores of students
- query the score with  some filters
- modify scores of students 
- query course

##1.check in the scores of students 

 We enter the correct infomation of one student, the backend database will store it.
