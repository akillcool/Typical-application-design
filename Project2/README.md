# Assignment 2: Implementation of Linked List Structures
Hauling Wang


## I.	Purpose: OOP & Doubly Linked List Data Structures, and Generic Classes in Java

## II.	Program Description:

   The exercise is aimed at practicing the object-oriented
programming methodology and the implementation of linked list data
structures in Java.

   The OOP features, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and
generic classes will be used. The basic doubly-linked list structures including
List, Stack, Queue and sorted queue will be defined using Java reference type.


## III.	Specification:

   Define the following generic classes with at least the following members with
the following structures:

  // In file MyList.java 
  ```java
  public class MyList<C> {

     // Two inner classes
     protected class Node {
       // Node constructor, data and function members
       ....
     }

     protected class ListIterator implements Iterator<C> {
       // ListerIterator's constructor, data and function members
       ....
     }

     // Mylist constructors, data and function members
     .....

  }
```
  // In file MyStack.java
 ```java
  public class MyStack<C> extends MyList<T>{
     // MyStack's function members and overriding MyList's insert() and
     // remove member functions so that the two functions will not be
     // called from my stack. All other functions will be inherited here.
     // Don't define inner classes, and related functions, they are inherited.
  }

  // In file MyQueue.java
 
  public class MyQueue<C> extends MyList<T>{  ... }

  // In file SortedQueue.java

  public class SortedQueue<C> extends MyList<T>{ ... }
 ```

### Specifications of Classes and Their Members
..............|...............+...........................................
   Class      | Base class    | Members
--------------+------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Node       | Object        | Node class is an inner class of MyList
				public constructor(s)
			        T info; Node next, previous;

  ListIterator<E> Iterator<E>   An inner class of MyList
                                public ListIterator( boolean dir );
				protected Node currentNode;
  				protected bool forward;
				public boolean hasNext();
				public E	next();
				public void    remove(); // optional

   MyList<C>   Object,          public constructor(s)
	       Iterable<C>	protected Node<C> front, rear; int count;
				public boolean isEmpty();
				public int	size();
				public void	insert(C obj, int position);
				public C remove( int position );

                                // MyList methods.
				public Iterator<C> iterator() { iterator( true ); }
				public Iterator<C> iterator(boolean direction) {
                                         return ListIterator( direction );
                                } 

  MyStack<T>    MyList<T>       A derived class of MyList
                                public constructor(s)
				void	push( T obj );
				T	pop();
				T	top(); // return object on top without removing it

  MyQueue<T>    MyList<T>       A derived class of MyList
                                public constructor(s)
				public void	enque( T ) ; // to the end.
				public T	deque(); // remove object from front. 

  SortedQueue<T>  MyList<T>	A derived class of MyList
                                public constructors
				public void insert( T obj ); // Keep queue sorted keys.
				public T remove ( T obj);

Notice that the insert() and remove() must be hidden in the derived MyStack,
MyQueue and SortedQueue classes.

## IV.	Things worth to mention:

  1. Randomly generate mixed N members (including Member's subclass objects).
     When an object is generated, insert the the same node in each of
     the three data structures, so that all data structures contains
     the same set of members but in different order.
  2. An class can 'extends' one class and can 'implements' many interfaces.
  3. An interface can 'extends' many interfaces.
  4. Methods in interfaces are always abstract and public even if you don't
     specify them that way.
  5. Data members in interface are always static and final even if you don't
     specify that way.
  6. A abstract function is function begun with 'abstract' or any function defined
     in an interface.
  7. When a class implements an interface and the class doesnâ€™t implement all
     function in the interface, the class is an abstract.
  8. Abstract class can be used to define a variable but cannot be used to
     instantanciate a variable. That is, you cannot use interface or abstract as
     operand of the 'new' operator.e
